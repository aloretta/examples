With a list of critic reviews provided in <code>critics.csv</code> we train and test different models to classify 
whether a review is "fresh" (favorable) or "rotten" (unfavorable) for different movies. Complete notebook is in the
<code>rotten_tomatoes.html</code> file. Parts of this document are written in LaTeX, so it is best to use rawgit.com
or a similar site to render it.
